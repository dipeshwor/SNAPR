### What is SNAPR? 
SNAPR - Snap, Narrate, Auto Post and Reflec is a tool that lets students capture and populate their e-portfolios automatically. In making/engineering, there is an emphasis on the final product and the ‘in-between’ stages are often ignored. We hope SNAPR will help students reflect on the ‘in-between’ stages and encourage them to share stories of the processes that led to the final product.
